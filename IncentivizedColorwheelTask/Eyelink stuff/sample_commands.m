% Before you record any data, you have to initialize the Eyelink with the
% parameters you want to use (including details about how to perform a
% calibration
EyelinkInitDefaults(pms.wid); % here pms.wid refers to the window you've opened
pms.el = EyelinkSetup(1,pms); % here pms are just parameters for my particular task
% note that the only parameter I use in EyelinkSetup is the pointer for my
% window; Also note that EyelinkSetup contains a commands to run the
% calibration rountine itself

% once you've set up Eyelink, you can start recording at any point in the
% script you like:
Eyelink('StartRecording')

% you can sample data from the Eyelink, using MATLAB (if you want to save
% data locally in your .mat data file
sample = getEyelinkData();
x = sample(1); y = sample(2); %get the x and y coordinates of the current eye trace
p = sample(3); st = sample(4);

% When you're done recording you can stop the Eyelink system and reset your
% configuration parameters
Eyelink('Stoprecording')
pms.el = EyelinkSetup(0,pms);

% During my task, participants must look at a central fixation cross for 1
% sec for the trial to proceed. Since the calibration for gaze location
% might drift over time, I've built in a drift calibration routine using
% while loops to ask whether Participants are looking at a specified
% location. They can press a spacebar (coded in param.allowedResps.drift)
% if they think they are and the trial isn't starting. That toggles into a
% second "drift correction" while loop that allows the experimenter to
% press 'd' for "drift correction" (param.allowedResos.driftOK) when they
% are satisfied that the participant is looking at the center of the
% screen, and this sets a value pair called "driftShift" which subsequently
% adjusts all future X,Y value pairs collected from the Eyelink. note that
% wRect is just the monitor window rectangle, wid, is the window ID
% pointer, parm.bkgd is a rectangle in which I want stimuli to be
% displayed.

% Ensure central fixation before showing trial
